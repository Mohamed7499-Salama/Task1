          <h1>A quite different first edition</h1>
          Sauvestre proposed stonework pedestals to dress the legs,
          monumental arches to link the columns and the first level,
          large glass-walled halls on each level, a bulb-shaped design
          for the top and various other ornamental features to decorate
          the whole of the structure. In the end the project was simplified,
          but certain elements such as the large arches at the base were retained,
          which in part give it its very characteristic appearance.<br><br>

          The curvature of the uprights is mathematically determined to offer
          the most efficient wind resistance possible. As Eiffel himself explains:
          "All the cutting force of the wind passes into the interior of the leading
          edge uprights. Lines drawn tangential to each upright with the point of each 
          tangent at the same height, will always intersect at a second point, which is
          exactly the point through which passes the flow resultant from the action of
          the wind on that part of the tower support situated above the two points in question.
          Before coming together at the high pinnacle, the uprights appear to burst out of
          the ground, and in a way to be shaped by the action of the wind".
